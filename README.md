Canvas Conf.
============

It was great to see everyone at the Canvas Conf. in Birmingham. Thanks again to 383 Project for putting on a great show.

This repo contains my slides and demo code from my talk at the conference. I hope you find both useful.

Please get in touch if you have any further questions.
