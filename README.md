Canvas Conf.
============

It was great to see everyone at the Canvas Conf. in Birmingham. Thanks again to 383 Project for putting on a great show.

This repo contains my slides and demo code from my talk at the conference. I hope you find both useful.

Please get in touch if you have any further questions.

Live Demo Code

The completed project from my live coding demo can be found in the /demo folder of this repository.

	* /CanvasDemo/Controllers/PusherController.cs
